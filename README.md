# Super fast recursive Fibonacci implementation in LuaX

The Fibonacci sequence is a classical hello-world application for functional
programming. The challenge here is to get a fast implementation. We will first
show two classical implementations: the trivial recursive definition that is
very slow and the iterative version that is slightly faster.

And a third one that is blazing fast.

So here is my own version...

- the source code in LuaX: [fib.lua](fib.lua)
- the source code of the document for Typst: [fib.typ](fib.typ)
- the document rendered in PDF: [lua-fibonacci.pdf](http://cdelord.fr/pub/lua-fibonacci.pdf)
